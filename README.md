To run the app, type in terminal `bash src/monkey-write.sh $1', where $1 is the number of words in the sentence.

I made a monkey cow to use in cowsay (*src/monkey.cow*). You can use it by copying it to the cowsay file folder (`cp src/monkey.cow /usr/share/cowsay/cows`, maybe sudo it) and specifying `cowsay -f monkey`.

Example:

```bash src/monkey-write.sh 25 | cowsay -f monkey
